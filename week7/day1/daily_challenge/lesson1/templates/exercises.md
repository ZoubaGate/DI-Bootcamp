#Login application in Flask

*Here, we will create a login application in the flask where a login page* (login.html) is shown to the user which prompts to enter the email and password. If the password is "jtp", then the application will redirect the user to the success page (success.html) where the message and a link to the profile (profile.html) is given otherwise it will redirect the user to the error page.

___The controller python flask script (login.py) controls the behaviour of the application. It contains the view functions for the various cases. The email of the user is stored on the browser in the form of the cookie. If the password entered by the user is "jtp", then the application stores the email id of the user on the browser as the cookie which is later read in the profile page to show some message to the user.__
